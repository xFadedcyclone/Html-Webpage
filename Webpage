              New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens,
              Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the
              home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the
              City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is
              currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by
              tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore
              wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times
              Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings,
              Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was
              named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that
              location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York
              City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and
              allow ease of transportation.
